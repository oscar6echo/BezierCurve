## Bezier Curves ##

Bezier curves, or rather [Casteljau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Casteljau)-[Bezier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier), are immediately clear with a picture/animation, as opposed to digging into the [formulae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve).

Based [d3.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).

This is heavily inspired by [Jason Davies](http://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/)'s page.
